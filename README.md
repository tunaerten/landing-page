### What I learned

It wasn't a very challenging project, but it was quite fun. I started with the mobile design first. I think next time, even if I begin with the mobile design, I'll organize the components with the desktop design in mind. I'll design each section (mobile, tablet, desktop) not separately but as a whole.

I had quite a hard time adjusting images for different screen sizes. I had to do a lot of research, especially between the hero image on large screens and tablets. When I first wrote the code, I didn't use the picture tag, but I later changed the hero section. Next time, Iâ€™ll plan the images for different screen sizes better from the start.

The last change I made before publishing the page was adjusting the heading font size according to the page size. I used clamp for this. I'm not sure if it's the ideal ap proach. I achieved the result I wanted, but I'm open to your advice on this.
